# Roemer-Arboretum-Research
## Directed Study @ SUNY Geneseo | Spring 2017: 

I utilized transect data from a 1999 study of the Roemer Arboretum to parameterize a transition matrix model that predicts the arboretum’s future tree composition. I calculated the Shannon diversity index of the transect’s adult-tree community to quantify both its observed and future (predicted) tree diversity.
